# 🧠 Day 6 – Vector Spaces & Basis Vectors

## ✅ Key Concepts

### Vector Space
A vector space is a world where:
- Vectors exist
- Vector addition & scalar multiplication is valid
- Zero vector exists: `[0, 0]`
- Rules like associativity, commutativity apply

### Basis Vectors
In 2D:
- î = [1, 0] → x-direction
- ĵ = [0, 1] → y-direction
Any vector `[a, b] = a × î + b × ĵ`

## 📝 Section A – True/False (Your Answers)

1. `[2, 5] + [3, -1]` is valid in a vector space. ✅ **True**
2. `[4, 0]` can be written as `4 × î + 0 × ĵ`. ✅ **True**
3. Zero vector does not belong to a vector space. ✅ **False**
4. `[3, 2]` is built using `[1, 0]` and `[0, 1]`. ❌ **False** (Correct Answer: True)

## ✍️ Section B – Basis Vector Form

5. `[5, 2]` = **5î + 2ĵ**  
6. `[0, -3]` = **0î - 3ĵ**  
7. `[-2, 4]` = **-2î + 4ĵ**  

Score: 3/3
